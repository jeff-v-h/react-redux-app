# React and Redux App in ES6
This app follows the course 'Building Applications in React and Redux in ES6' by Cory House on Pluralsight.
The starter kit is at https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter

## READ FIRST NOTE 
It was intended to be created as an example demo for building a react app from scratch. It may be more beneficial to follow project 'test-upload-suite-fe' as a more current demonstration. Test Upload Suite Front-End was created following some of the instructions in this tutorial but adapting changes that have occurred since this course was created.

## Updates and Current Differences
The differences from this course until Test Upload Suite project:
 
Currently to create an app from scratch, ensure Node.js (and therefore npm) is installed. Then in project directory, run `npm init react-app app-name` to create new react app. This will install 3 dependencies:
- react-dom
- react
- react-scripts

React-scripts includes babel, webpack, eslint etc as seen here https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/next/packages/react-scripts/package.json 

## Additional Dependencies
- jquery
- boostrap
